# Methods {}

Top level header which will be numbered when the child is imported into the master .Rmd upon knit.\\

`\\` at the end of a line forces a hard return. Two returns after a line also forces a hard return.

## Bioinformatic Pipeline {.unnumbered}

`.unnumbered` removes autonumbering of headers when the child is imported into the master .Rmd.

To refer to a table generated by a chunk, use (Table \@ref(tab:TableName)). The name of the chunk that generates the table should be the same as the name of the table, the name should be one word letters only. A kable caption appears upon running a chunk and upon knit.

```{r TableName}
TableName <- summary(cars)

TableName %>%
  kable(caption = "Insert caption here")
```

To refer to a figure generated by a chunk, use (Figure \@ref(fig:FigureName)). The name of the chunk that generates the figure should be the same as the name of the figure, the name should be one word letters only. A figure caption will not appear upon running the chunk but will appear upon knit. Use the glue function to generate a figure caption. Glue allows you to add chunks of text (in quotes) and code (not in quotes) together.

```{r FigureName, fig.cap = FigureName_cap}
FigureName_cap <- glue("Insert caption here", "The maximum speed in cars is", max(cars$speed), .sep = " ")

FigureName <- plot(cars)
FigureName
```

To refer to a figure from an external source, use (Figure \@ref(fig:ExternalFigure)). Use `knitr::include_graphics` to call the figure from the folder which contains the external figure file (FigureMaterial here).

```{r ExternalFigure, fig.cap = ExternalFigure_cap}
ExternalFigure_cap <- glue("Insert caption here")

knitr::include_graphics(file.path(FigureMaterial,"ExternalFigure.png")) 
```

To cite literature or software or databases, paste inline the citekey from the object in Zotero enclosed in []. 
Use [@DatabaseResourcesNational2016] for one citation or [@grigorievGenomePortalDepartment2012; @nordbergGenomePortalDepartment2014] for multiple citations.

Within .Rmd text, subscript is marked with `~Text~`, H~2~O~2~; superscript is marked with `^Text^`, ^•^NO; italics is marked with `*Text*`, *in vivo*; bold  is marked with `**Text**`, **bold**. 

Equations instead follow rules from LaTEX. Within an equation, subscript is marked with `_Text`, superscript is marked with `^Text`. 

\begin{equation}
2H_2O_2 → 2H_2O + O_2
 (\#eq:EquationName)
\end{equation}

To cite an equation, use (Equation \@ref(eq:EquationName)). 

In child.Rmd, r code chunks run as normal. 

```{r MaxCarsSpeed}
max(cars$speed)
```

To refer to the output of r code in text, use `r max(cars$speed)`. 

## Data Dictionary {.unnumbered}

Accumulate a Data Dictionary in a Google Sheet with the columns; Variable, containing each variable name; Units, containing the units for each variable if any; Definition, containing a single definition for each variable to be used with each mention of the variable.\\
Search for variable names by running all chunks to generate variables and then running ` objects()` or `ls()` in the console.
